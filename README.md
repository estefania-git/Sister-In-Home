# Sister-In-Home
This project is aimed at those mothers who do not know who to leave their children with. That's why this idea was born Sister in Home. In the application you can find the babysitters closest to your location, see their ratings, their description and choose the one that best suits your needs. You can start a conversation with them and reach an agreement.
